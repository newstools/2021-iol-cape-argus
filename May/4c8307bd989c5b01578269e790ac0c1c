Cape Town - We’ve all have our fair share of embarrassing pictures that sometimes we hope would never see the light of day. They remind us of a time we want to forget or more often than not, our poor choice in fashion and styling.

All roasts welcome,” he tweeted. Mense, I don't even know how to caption this throwback.
