KRISTIN ENGEL Cape Town - Residents of Lotus River have called for a permanent solution to the continued overflow and stench of sewage spills in Oribi Avenue, resulting from the main sewer collapse at Cape Peninsula Organisation for the Aged (CPOA) retirement village, House Morea almost two years ago. Oribi Avenue street committee secretary Franco Rudolph said various meetings were held with the relevant ward councillors, only to be met with short-term solutions and empty promises from the City. “The community has been grappling with the smell of faeces and urine for years and despite the City sending in contractors to pump out the sewer and install a temporary over-pumping system, there is still no final result,” said Rudolph. Rudolph said the contractors did not adhere to the relevant safety and health protocols when doing the maintenance work and as a community they were concerned about their health and safety. Lotus River resident Paul Phillips said that the over-pumping system still leaves the stench of sewage wafting through the area. “The pumping machine is right outside my house, we can’t even open our kitchen windows because of the terrible stench of the sewage and exhaust fumes,” he said. Water and waste management mayoral committee member Xanthea Limberg said a private contractor has not been appointed yet to resolve the issue completely. She said the City was waiting for the annual tender after the initial award was appealed, so there is currently no permanent solution. Limberg said they were not able to provide a time-frame as to how long the issue would take to be completely resolved. kristin.engel@inl.co.za Cape Argus
