Cape Town – With the cold and winter months approaching and staying warm becomes essential, one way that Dis-Chem has decided to assist is by donating 5 200 blankets. This year 5 200 blankets will be distributed to 33 organisations nominated by Dis-Chem’s Facebook followers and Dis-Chem Pharmacy staff. The initiative is going into its sixth year, and blankets were donated to children’s homes, old age homes and animal shelters. The organisations that received blankets in Western Cape are Breadline Africa, Hagars choice place of safety, Hannahs Place of Safety, House of Thembiso, Kraaifontein; Little Brinks, Mitchells Plain Crisis Line, Rusthof Old Age Home and SOS Children’s Villages. Dis-Chem Foundation’s Sherry Saltzman said: “Every year that we have run this initiative, we get overwhelmed by the reaction of the communities we help. “The sheer gratitude we receive is so pure, and it reminds us how important the Dis-Chem Foundation is. “Our own Dis-Chem customer community is vitally important to us as it is their purchases that are helping us to fund our initiatives, so it makes sense for them to have a say in the donation nominations,” Saltzman said. “The Covid-19 pandemic is still very much with us, and with the winter months approaching, the risk of getting sick is higher. Everyone deserves to have as warm a winter as possible, which is why even the smallest contribution goes a long way,” Saltzman said. Cape Argus .
