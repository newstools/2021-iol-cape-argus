Cape Town - From horse-drawn trams to modernised electrical buses, the Golden Arrow Bus Service (GABS) has been transporting Capetonians for well over a century. GABS operates just over 1 000 buses during peak hours, serving more than 3 100 routes in the metro. Golden Arrow conveys approximately 250 000 passengers each weekday, with an annual rate of 60 million passengers. The bus service recently posted about a job opportunity that people who are interested in becoming GABS drivers should take note of. There are some requirements that listed for interested applicants including a Grade 12 (Matric) certificate and 2-year heavy vehicle driving experience.

GABS operation manager Mario Gaffley, who has been working for GABS for 24 years, said working at the company was a dream come true. Jamiel Adams, who resigned in February, celebrated 47 years of working for GABS, starting as a body builder apprentice for City Tramways in 1974. “The company had the Leyland single decker and double-decker at the time. The double-deckers had no passenger doors, you had to board the bus at its back as each bus had a driver and a conductor.” Looking back at the golden moments at the company, he highlighted one of his most treasured memories. “One of my bigger achievements was when we trained three women to become spray painters. Today, the three women are qualified spray painters, and they are working permanently at GABS. “They are the first and only women qualified spray painters in the Western Cape. We are busy training more learners and apprentices for the future of Golden Arrow.” Cape Argus
