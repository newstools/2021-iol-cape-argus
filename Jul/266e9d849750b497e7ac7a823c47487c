If you can see the Drakenstein mountain range you will soon realise why those in the Western Cape are experiencing such icy weather. Snowfall has turned areas like Cederberg, Matroosberg and Ceres into a winter wonderland. Unfazed by the icy weather, families braved the cold to have some fun in the snow. It’s not everyday that little ones get to build a snowman or throw snowballs. If, however, you’re not one of the lucky ones who got to frolic in the snow, social media will certainly provide a peek of what those have experienced. From snow covered landscapes to grown-ups getting in touch with their inner child, these images show how people had fun in the snow.
