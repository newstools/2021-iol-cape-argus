So, President Cyril Ramaphosa has, once again, dipped his hand in the ban jar and pulled out the 'ban alcohol for two weeks' ticket. What is the purpose of such a ban? No, really! In the past, we have been told that it is to help reduce alcohol-caused injuries that take up hospital beds needed for the Covid third wave victims. If that were true, instead of banning alcohol, with its resulting unemployment and damage to the industry, how about enforcing the rule of law regarding illegal super-spreader events. No, just kidding. That would have required a modicum of logic, or even common sense. And in any case we don't have a functioning police service to carry out enforcement of the rule of law. Just a couple of days ago, we had that EFF idiot and his march on Sahpra. Now we have Edward Zuma, who has been well taught by his dad that the law doesn't apply to him. He says, "We are prepared to die". Right on! These people wouldn't recognise common sense and democracy if both bit them on their backsides. * Phil Greenlees, Pinelands. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
