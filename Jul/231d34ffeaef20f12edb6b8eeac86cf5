Cape Town - The British and Irish Lions rugby team landed in Cape Town on Sunday evening ahead of the three-match series, including a long-awaited Test match against the Springboks. The Springboks also arrived in the city yesterday, ahead of the match on Wednesday. The Springboks took up residence in the city centre while the visiting team will split their time between the city and the Overberg as the teams prepare for the first of three Tests. The British and Irish Lions take on the Springboks at Cape Town Stadium on July 24 – their first Test in the city since their series-opening victory in 1997. They also take on the South Africa ‘A’ team (July 14) and the Stormers (July 17, TBC) and at the same venue in their final warm-up matches before the Test series begins. 🗣️ “We look forward to giving them the world-famous Cape Town hospitality"➡️ More here: https://t.co/YfGGYqms1n#CastleLionsSeries #StrongerTogether #StrongerForever @CityofCT pic.twitter.com/pCVkdH2eGD The schedule for the Cape Town leg is: “This first Test match has been on our minds almost since the day we won the Rugby World Cup, so to be here in Cape Town for the final preparations is really exciting,” said Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s director of rugby. “It’ll be the first Test match ever played at the Cape Town Stadium and it’s special to think that this group will be the trail blazers for the venue if you think of the century of tradition that was laid down at Newlands. It’s a new venue for us and it’s also the start of a new history." Plato welcomed the team’s arrival in the city, although strict Covid-19 compliance protocols meant it could not be in person. “‘It is really a pleasure to have the British and Irish Lions in our beautiful city. We look forward to giving them the world famous Cape Town hospitality. We are proud to partner with SA Rugby for the Cape Town leg of the tour. “As a rugby-loving city, we are disappointed that they will not be able to experience the atmosphere of a packed Cape Town Stadium, but we promise to make their stay in Cape Town a memorable experience,” said Plato. Mayco Member for Safety and Security JP Smith said: “Our team in the Events Department is working with SA Rugby and the Cape Town Stadium to finalise the logistics for all three games to be played at the stadium. “We will also make sure that the City of Cape Town’s Protocols for Hosting Safe Events during Covid-19 is implemented to ensure the safety of the players, team officials, staff and personnel who will be at the stadium during the games.” The teams will spend two weeks in the city before they are scheduled to return to Gauteng for the final two Tests.
