Cape Town - Ladles of Love is gearing up for yet another massive initiative for the commemoration of Mandela Day on July 18. This year, the charitable organisation is looking to break the Guinness World Records for the longest line of food cans by sourcing 90 000 tins of food and break Canada’s current record of 44 966 cans. Ladles of Love founder Danny Diliberto said: “Mandela Day is a global call to action that celebrates the idea that each individual can make an impact. We embrace that fully and each year we try to create a platform to honour Madiba’s life and legacy by rallying active citizens to do good. “This year we thought why not break the current Canadian-held record of 3.28km for 44 966 cans. Our target is 90 000 cans that will measure 6.7 km long. Our Mandela Day message is simple, we are asking Capetonians to volunteer 67 minutes of their time with us and help smash that record. “Last year, we broke a  world record for the most amount of sandwiches made in one hour, and It was a great way to fill an immediate need for food and raise funds for our ongoing food programmes. This year 90 000 cans mean 36 900kg of food that we will distribute to over 300 partner community kitchens. This will help us fight hunger a little more. So we are calling on people to donate, sponsor and join our planned initiatives,” said Diliberto. The record-breaking attempt will take place outdoors at the V&A Waterfront on July 18, and volunteers will be lining up canned tins fish, vegetables, lentils and soup in efforts to break the record. V&A Waterfront chief executive David Green said: “Food Security is a key dimension of our social impact strategy at the V&A Waterfront. We have huge respect for and value our long-term partnership with the Ladles of Love team, as a natural extension of our work to build a more sustainable, local, and ethical food system in Cape Town.” nomalanga.tshuma@inl.co.za Cape Argus
