Belgian restaurant Den Anker has used the power of social media to reach out to University of Cape Town residence students in need of food amid raging fires that destroyed parts of the university on Sunday. In a Twitter post, the restaurant wrote they would be serving the students for a week but they needed to bring their residence card as proof. “Any UCT res students who have been directly affected by the fire are welcome to come over to Den Anker this evening. “We will serve you a plate of food, you will need to provide us with proof of your res card. #DenAnker #NewlandsFire #UCTStudents #Fire #CapeTownFire,” they wrote. “We’re extending the UCT dinners for the week. We will provide a different meal each night. Tonight is spaghetti bolognese. #DenAnker #NewlandsFire #CapeTownFires #UCTStudents #Fire #CapeTownFire,” they added.
