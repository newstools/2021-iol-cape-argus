Cape Town - The province’s Department of Social Development will employ 143 social work graduates and have set aside R20 million to make it happen. The initiative will go a long way in addressing the province’s desperate need for skilled social workers. Social Development MEC Sharna Fernandez announced the plan, and said that it was one of the ways the province can employ and develop recently graduated workers. “Many of the social work graduates are appointed on a contractual basis to fulfil their respective bursary obligations. We are aware of the need for social work services across the province and, as such, we remain committed to ensuring that there are opportunities for further development and training of social work graduates. “Social work is a dynamic and demanding occupation, that requires a diversity of skills and qualities. Whether these skills are distinctive or learned, success in the field requires social workers to continually develop themselves throughout their career,” said Fernandez. She added that in light of the many social challenges in the province and the country at large, it was critical that the public service social workers were committed and given sufficient capacity, to carry out difficult tasks and serve people in need with dignity.
