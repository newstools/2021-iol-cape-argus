by Kristin Engel Cape Town - Thundercat enthusiasts from around the country gathered in Struisbaai on April 3 and 4 to participate in the inaugural Two Oceans Challenge, the first race to take place since the hard lockdown. Forty-six boating teams and 92 participants, the highest number of entries since 2012, were competing to win prizes worth more than R120 000. Competitors found that their techniques, speed and endurance were challenged in an action-packed surf race on the first day of the challenge, and passing the southernmost tip of Africa in the 144km long-haul race on the second day. Renier le Roux travelled from Gauteng to compete in the event and finished second behind Marc Gleed. “The competition was tough, but lekker,” Le Roux said. Behind Le Roux were: Dave Barnett (3rd), Ben Viljoen (4th),  Elandre Human and  Reghardt Roets. The event organiser, Hermann van Geems, said it was by far the biggest race within the past 12 years, bringing 46 boating teams together to test speed and endurance. Some of the participants included: The inaugural Two Oceans Challenge was sponsored by a variety of organisations, but most notably Aquila Collection, the owner of the newly opened CatchCook Restaurant in Struisbaai, where the prize-giving was held at the end of each day’s racing. kristin.engel@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
