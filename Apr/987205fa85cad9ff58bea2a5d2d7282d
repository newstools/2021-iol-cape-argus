The caption on Page 4 main picture of April 22 (see below) incorrectly stated that the South African Cape Corps Military Veterans Association (SACCMVA) march through Cape Town to Parliament to hand over a memorandum of demands. The march was in fact by the SACC Forum. The caption also incorrectly stated that the SACC consisted of brown/Khoisan soldiers who were part of the former South African Defence Force (SADF). The SACCMVA has pointed out that the SACCâ€™s (South African Cape Corps) mandate was to train and deploy Brown soldiers and not Khoisan soldiers. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.
