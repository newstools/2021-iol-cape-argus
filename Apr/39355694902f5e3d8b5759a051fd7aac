by KRISTIN ENGEL Cape Town - The launch of BlueCape, a collaborative partnership between the V&A Waterfront and the City, is set to reimagine South Africa’s ocean economy. It will unlock value and focus on three key marine industries: marine manufacturing, ocean sports and super-yachts. The non-profit entity seeks to support these three areas and will make a significant contribution to economic growth, job creation and social upliftment. Bruce Tedder, one of the founding directors of BlueCape, welcomed the partnership with the V&A Waterfront and the City at the launch. “BlueCape is a catalyst, a facilitator, an enabler. We want to connect the dots in the ocean economy, in the sectors we are passionate about. BlueCape is all about transformation and skills training in meaningful jobs that do exist but lack training facilities.” BlueCape aims to knock down existing barriers of entry by providing more open access, support skills development, transformation and job creation, and create economic opportunities for the marine industry to succeed. Luciano Peterson, one of BlueCape’s lifeguard qualification recipients, attended the launch as well. “It is a worthwhile experience and I was able to meet new people with different opportunities. BlueCape is offering great opportunities for the younger generation. I’m thankful to be a part of it and I look forward to nurturing my career.” David Green, V&A Waterfront chief executive, said they would assist Blue Cape and eventually create a Blue Ocean Economy, a cluster of associated businesses at the Waterfront. “BlueCape will facilitate opportunities to make more productive and sustainable use of our oceans, and to create inclusive business opportunities in these industries. “The essence of the Waterfront derives from it being connected to the ocean and the working harbour, to reconnect the citizens of Cape Town with the ocean.” Mayco member for economic opportunities and asset management James Vos said he set his sights on new and emerging markets and sectors that would transform the economic geography of Cape Town by looking at ways to diversify the economy, which was why the City chose to collaborate with the industry-opening BlueCape. “It made perfect sense for us to push this opportunity with BlueCape as this sector constitutes the fastest-growing sector of the tourism industry.” kristin.engel@inl.co.za Cape Argus
