In response to Sandra Dickson’s comment in the article, “City of Cape Town ditching water meter devices” (Cape Argus, 21 April), that there has been “a major increase in bulk water purchases from R500 million to R2.5 million annually”. There has not been a drastic increase in bulk purchases. Like all other municipalities, the City is adhering to the National Treasury requirement to report Bulk Purchases as Inventory. There is therefore not an increase in volume of water provided. It is an increase in value (price of the product, i.e. Potable Bulk Water versus the price of material item, i.e Raw Bulk Water) due to the change in reporting standards. The increase in expenditure value is covered by the “Gains” reflected under Revenue as part of the same reporting standard. I hope this clarifies the matter. * Alderman Xanthea Limberg, Mayco member for water and waste services. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
