Cape Town - Four suspects will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court this morning for the  possession of an illegal firearm and multiple rounds of ammunition after they were arrested by police during a crime prevention operation in Philippi East. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said: “Police deployed to combat crime in Philippi East spotted a silver BMW in Dysa Street under suspicious circumstances. The vehicle was pulled over after a brief pursuit and searched, which led to the discovery of an unlicensed 9mm pistol and six rounds of ammunition. “The four occupants, aged between 25 and 51 years old, were arrested and are expected to make their court appearance in Athlone for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.” In a separate incident in Wynberg, two Law Enforcement officers apprehended a suspect for assault and robbery. According to Law Enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyson, officers patrolling the area were stopped by a member of the public in Main Road. “The person informed them that he was assaulted by a male with a firearm, who attempted to rob him. The two officers followed him into the house and apprehended the suspect in the yard as he tried to jump over the wall on to the train lines. The suspect was arrested for assault with a firearm,” said Dyson. Meanwhile, Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz has congratulated SA Police Service and Law Enforcement officers who have obtained results from their crime prevention operations despite facing a number of serious challenges. “It is easy to get caught up in the many negatives in our society. It is perhaps human nature to be more vocal about bad experiences than it is to be about good experiences. But I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of those dedicated SAPS officials who work under difficult circumstances to ensure that criminals are brought to book,” said Fritz.
