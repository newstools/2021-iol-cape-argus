In a front page report on March 29, 2021 on the cost of vandalism caused during protests at universities, we stated that UWC was among the most vandalised institutions. We accept that this was a misrepresentation of the figures provided in the statement of Higher Education, Science and Technology Minister, Blade Nzimande. We extend our apologies to UWC for any embarrassment caused. We also accept that the comment provided by it’s spokesperson, Gasant Abarder should have been more fully used. Yesterday Abarder said: “The University of the Western Cape (UWC) takes the security and safety of our students and staff very seriously. “We are however part of a broader society and not immune to acts of criminality or theft. “Our efforts are illustrated in that we suffered among the least damage out of the universities affected by vandalism and theft last year. “Out of R32 million worth of damage, two acts of vandalism cost the university R166 000. “This is because even though for most of the year, the campus had 33% of students and staff on campus due to lockdown regulations, we never compromised on security. “The university is becoming an anchor institution in the Bellville CBD and the greater Cape Town with a view to spreading our footprint and contributing not only to the safety and security of the area but also its economy. “An example is our move to a new Faculty of Community and Health Sciences building in the heart of the Bellville CBD in 2019. “In addition, we have invested significant resources on improving campus safety. “The Campus Protection Services team is on duty 365 days a year. “Security officers patrol the campus by foot, golf carts, quad vehicles and regular vehicles, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “Safety and security features include security cameras, improved lighting and security patrols.” Cape Argus
