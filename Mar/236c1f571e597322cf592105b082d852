by Dr HR Groenewald The parking problem in the CBD (town centre) of Mitchells Plain has existed for many years; I’ve experienced it for close on to 40 years of practising there as a doctor. The situation has, however, become infinitely worse after the institution of the Urban Renewal Programme. The CTCC’s hand was forced to “clean up” the town centre as a result of pressure from businesses in Symphony Walk; the informal trade proved to be a huge impediment to the success of their businesses. A huge portion of the private parking areas was converted into space for the informal sector, taxi rank and bus terminus. The CTCC’s town planners based their decision on an unsubstantiated conclusion that 80% plus of trade in the town centre was pedestrian which I presume was people either walking or coming there by taxi. The conversion of Seventh Avenue into a service road has made no difference to the parking problem, nor will it ever. I have, and will always, lay the blame at the door of the CTCC. Their action prompted the development of the promenade with anchor tenants deserting the town centre. * Dr HR Groenewald, Mitchell’s Plain. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
