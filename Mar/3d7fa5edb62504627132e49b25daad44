Cape Town - A group of residents in Parkwood are filling the gap left for recreational activities for the elderly and those unable to participate in strenuous physical activity, by introducing “walking soccer” to the community. One of the more popular recreational activities in the area is soccer, leaving a large number of people sidelined as they’re unable to participate. Residents have decided to introduce the cardio exercise, “walking soccer” especially  suited for the elderly and people with injuries. Resident Kariem Abdol, 61, said: “Walking soccer is aimed at those who find playing traditional soccer too strenuous, such as the elderly, and those who are overweight. As the name suggests, the main idea is that you may only walk while playing, whereas running results in an offence.” The group was introduced to the unconventional play at the Oasis Business Park in Schaapkraal at the beginning of last year, and have been participating at least twice a week. “The event that we will be hosting on Saturday is intended to introduce the Parkwood community to this form of sport, as there are other communities like Manenberg who have adopted it,” said Abdol. The event is scheduled to take place at 10am at the Parkwood sports field on Saturday, and is completely free of charge. “We’re looking at making it a regular event in the future,” said Abdol. Junaid Abels, 47, said: “The idea for this Saturday is to introduce walking soccer to Parkwood for the elderly and hopefully it is a success, and we can get the kids involved as well.” Cape Argus
