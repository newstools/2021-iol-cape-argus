Cape Town - Eleven month-old Akhimbali Mafentile’s mother is set to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s court Friday afternoon on a charge of murder and child neglect. The 20-year-old woman was arrested by police on Wednesday afternoon following the discovery of her son’s body in a dried-up dam in Bloekombos, Kraaifontein. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said: “The body of an 11-month-old baby boy was discovered near a dam in Wallacedene, Kraaifontein on Wednesday afternoon, following the child’s disappearance on March 21. “Detectives are probing all possibilities, and it is too soon to speculate on the circumstances surrounding the case at this stage. A single suspect, a 20-year-old female was arrested and is expected to make a court appearance on Friday (today) in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court on a charge of murder and child neglect.” Meanwhile, back home in the Marikana informal settlement, Kraaifontein community leaders and residents want answers regarding the horrific crime. Community leader Lelethu Somtsewu, one of the four women who found little Akhimbali’s body, said the community was still trying to digest the news of the child’s death when they found out that his mother had been arrested and charged. Somtsewu said: “We are still very shocked about what we discovered yesterday. That baby was innocent and we want to know why she would do that to a child she gave birth to.” CAS founder and community leader Linda Phito said: “We want answers, even though we could never understand what would have led someone to kill an innocent child. As we are waiting for the law to take its course, our community is deeply saddened by Akhimbali’s death.” Cape Argus
