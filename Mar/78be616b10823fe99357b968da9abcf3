Cape Town - Frustrated Waste Plan employees, accompanied by residents, community leaders, political organisations, and union members on Wednesday made their way to the facility in Kraaifontein to shut down the City’s waste management sub-contractor. According to the employees, on top of paying their employees only R13 an hour, Waste Plan does not cover their overtime or offer any provident benefits to its employees. The employees said that they were tired of being ill-treated by Waste Plan management. “R13 for hard labour is extortion. We want Waste Plan to leave this community immediately. We have tried to reason with them and they never once agreed to sit down with us and resolve our grievances. Instead, they hire armed guards to hide behind. If they can afford that, they can afford to offer us more than R1 increase a month.” Kraaifontein development forum secretary Zingisani Moepi Brazil said: “As community leaders, our loyalties lie with the community. We cannot sit back and allow them to be exploited by companies based in our community.” “Waste Plan has been approached by several concerned stakeholders regarding this matter and they have refused to resolve it so we have been left no choice but to ask them to leave. We want a company that will treat our workers right, if not, we will shut it down, that’s not impossible.” Community advisory services founder Linda Phito said: “Waste Plan has a contract with the City. The City cannot choose to sit back and watch our people be mistreated. Paying your employees R13 is not in accordance with labour laws. Meanwhile, the City says that while it’s aware of the matter it will not be getting involved. Spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said: “The City of Cape Town is aware of this matter. However, it  is not legally allowed to intervene.” Waste Plan management asked for more time to deliberate before they can respond. Cape Argus
