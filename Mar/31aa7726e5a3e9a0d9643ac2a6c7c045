Tuesday night’s episode of  "Love Island SA" had many people laughing at Xavier Haupt’s explanation when he had dumped Millie Terblanche after telling her he loved her. Religious viewers of the dating show were left in stitches when Xavier broke up with the quirky Millie after getting his head turned by bombshell Mischka Najar. During their break-up confrontation, when Millie had asked him to explain why he had dumped her after telling her that he loved her on national TV. Xavier responded that he meant it “as a person ”. From 'the L word' to the friend-zone in a matter of days – catch up on all the #LoveIslandSA 💛🏖 Xavier/Millie movements on @DStv! “I decided that I am going to get to know Mischka... and I was sad last night because it felt like if I made the decision to get to know her, I would lose you as a friend, and I love you so much as a person,” Xavier said. Millie responded: “I don’t know... It’s just like... It hurts cause you said you loved me.” Xavier answered: “I do love you...as a person.” “But you said that you were in love with me, and that you loved me,” Millie questioned. Xavier explained, while swallowing his words, that “I did say that but that as time went on, I just didn’t feel in love anymore, and I should’ve been more honest with you”. Viewers of the show were chuckling and left in awe of the moment, given how Xavier was backpeddling at lightning speed and finding an alternative meaning to “I love you”. LMAOOO so now Xavier is saying he said "I love you" to Millie because he loves her as a person, not because he's in love with herYhuuu amadoda #LoveIslandSA pic.twitter.com/k5YjltpPRM  “I love you as a person..” As opposed to what Xavier 😭 #LoveIslandSA  Xavier: I love youAsad: he meant he loves her as a person 😭Asad got lines for his bros too 🤣  It’s Xavier telling Millie he is in love with her just to tell her, he loves her as a person and they can be fuck buddies in the next episode as soon as he had a small conversation with a new girl... this is the toxic messy #LoveIslandSA  I know and enjoy. pic.twitter.com/IUlGlSTd3P  It’s Xavier’s changed behavior after spending just 10 minutes with Mischka for me. Lmaooo all of a sudden Millie was never his type and he’s not feeling the love. I hate men #LoveIslandSA  Millie had always said she was like here for fun and Xavier literally fetched her and publicly said he was falling in love with her?? Why did he even bother 🤮  Xavier never loved Millie and he’s wrong for letting her believe that he did #LoveIslandSA
