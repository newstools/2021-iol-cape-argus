Cape Town - Following a fatal drowning at Seaforth Beach, Simon’s Town, on Sunday, a concerned group of residents has petitioned the City to deploy lifeguards during peak hours and to erect permanent warning signage, in a bid to prevent further tragedies. At around 11.03am on Sunday, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Simon’s Town duty crew were called in to support Cape Medical Response (CMR) and police following a drowning at the beach, south of Simon’s Town. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said: “CMR paramedics conducted extensive CPR efforts on a 29-year-old male from Belhar who is believed to have been rescued from the water by bystanders, but sadly he has been declared deceased.” Police spokesperson, FC van Wyk said Simon’s Town police were investigating an inquest case following the incident. “A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death.” Shark Warrior Adventures co-director Jon Monsoon said there were no lifeguards at the beach as it was not considered a high-risk area for drownings. “I feel that because of its location Seaforth Beach falls out of the range of Cape Town’s ‘priority’ beach areas and in such a way is viewed as being of lesser importance and therefore not on the list to receive services such as lifeguards, but then at least we can expect some proper signage advising beachgoers as to the potential dangers and risks involved in activities such as rock-jumping.” Monsoon and his colleagues have served as informal lifeguards and first responders for the past five years and attended Sunday's fatal incident. They’re now calling on the public to support a petition for the deployment of lifeguards. “We have already committed to making our centre and its facilities available to any future lifeguards at no cost to give them a base from which to operate when they are on duty.” Cape Argus
