Cape Town - President Cyril Ramaphosa has honoured the late Western Cape freedom fighter, academic and community organiser Cecyl Esau by designating his funeral as a special provincial funeral. Premier Alan Winde had written to Ramaphosa on Tuesday putting in the request on behalf of Esau’s family. Esau, who was born in Worcester, was an anti-apartheid activist who was involved in the 1976 national student uprising while studying at UWC. He was arrested for his political activities in 1986 and spent 12 years imprisoned on Robben Island. According to the policy for state funerals, Category 2 Special Provincial Funerals may be held for “distinguished persons specifically designated by the president of South Africa on request by the premier of a province”. Winde welcomed the news, stating that Esau's funeral will take place in Worcester on Saturday. “As part of the funeral arrangements, the South African Police Service will provide ceremonial elements, and the flag will be flown at half- mast in the province on the day. “The announcement by the president will ensure that we can aptly honour his memory and his contribution to the Western Cape and to South Africa as a whole. Winde added: “We extend our condolences to Mr Esau’s family, friends and loved ones at this difficult time.” Cape Argus
