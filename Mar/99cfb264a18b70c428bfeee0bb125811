CAPE TOWN – The City of Cape Town is planning to review its informal trading by-law and is inviting residents to give their input. In a statement released on Thursday, mayoral committee member for urban development, Alderman Grant Twigg, said the review was necessary to allow the city to grow and be managed in a changing economic and social environment while supporting the sector. He said residents would be able to comment and make suggestions on ways to improve the existing informal trading by-law until Friday, April 30, which would then be considered when drafting the amended by-law. This by-law was first promulgated on November 20, 2009, and reviewed again on December 6, 2013. “The City of Cape Town recognises the significance of the informal traders and their contribution to the economy and poverty reduction. “Informal trading helps with creating employment opportunities that in turn contribute to the household income,” Twigg said. He said it was therefore an opportune time to review not only the work done in the country with regards to the informal economy, but also the realities and lessons learnt during the Covid-19 pandemic. “We want the public to be a part of this review process and encourage them, especially informal traders, to read the existing by-law and provide feedback, based on their experience, so that we can work together towards improving it and continue to grow and support this important sector,” Twigg said. He said all comments and suggestions received would be evaluated and a review report would be compiled and submitted to council, which would then make a recommendation on which comments and suggestions should be formally included in the process. To participate in this process, residents can access the information at their nearest area economic development offices, subcouncil offices and city libraries. African News Agency (ANA)
