During her career, Grootboom was given the honour of presenting Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's state funeral along with others like actor Akhumzi Jezile. Fans and avid isiXhosa news viewers will miss Grootboom, especially her closing line after every bulletin ‚Äì ‚Äúndinithanda nonke emakhaya‚Äù, which loosely translates to ‚ÄúI love you all at home‚Äù.
