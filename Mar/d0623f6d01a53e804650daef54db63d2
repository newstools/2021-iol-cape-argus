Cape Town - An initiative to upskill and uplift women from local communities has been launched by the City’s Social Development Department in partnership with the Early Childhood Development Directorate. Plans for the programme, called Women For Change, were set in motion four months ago and saw a group of women in the Lansdowne area undergo skill development training. Head of the initiative Mark Kleinschmidt, a Lansdowne councillor, said: “Unemployment and GBV issues are prevalent in my community and I felt that there was something that can be done to uplift the women in my community and empower them to better their lives. I believe that once these women are empowered and gain employment, our community as a whole will benefit,” said Kleinschmidt. Participants from the programme received their training at the Lansdowne Civic Centre and have since been stationed at several local primary schools, among them Portia Primary, Sunlands Primary and Groenvlei High School. Participants received training in substance abuse awareness, truancy spotting, life orientation skills, and the reporting of service delivery complaints and requests by Lansdowne residents. The training was facilitated by the City's Expanded Public Works Programme and City social workers. “Principals have welcomed the Women for Change members. These women play an integral role at the schools where their assistance is required. The aspect of social care for seniors and persons with disabilities will also take place as the participants identify those in need. This is a great initiative and, as a community, we are happy to see it off the ground and running,” said Kleinschmidt. Cape Argus
