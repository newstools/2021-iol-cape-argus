Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has taken its Business Hub on the road, in order to reach more small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) in need of support and guidance, as it tries to recover from the blows of the Covid-19 pandemic. Executive mayor Dan Plato with mayco member for economic opportunities and asset management James Vos, launched the mobile business hub at the Civic Centre, on Thursday. The mobile business help desk will take the Enterprise and Investment Department's services to communities across the city, assisting entrepreneurs and SMMEs with setting up or improving their businesses through advice, training and workshops, networking opportunities and reducing red-tape. “Businesses, especially SMMEs, are the backbone of our City’s economy. “About 60-80 of the businesses in our City fall in the category of SMMEs and so the mobile business hub will really compliment and supplement all the services across the various departments.” With the establishment of a business hub in August 2019, the demand SMME support was evident, even prior to the pandemic, said Vos. “There’s a lot of work that goes into supporting small businesses, cutting red-tape, helping them to draw up a business plan, how to get start-up funding, smart procurement and supplier development. “There are so many aspects to supporting small businesses.” To assess the free service, www.investcapetown.com or email business.support@capetown.gov.za Cape Argus
