Cape Town - Twenty-Four fresh and vibrant productions from the Western Cape are set to dazzle audiences at this year’s Baxter Zabalaza Theatre Festival. More than 200 participants are set to showcase their talent at this year’s festival after months of preparation. Despite Covid-19 curbs, the event is expected to draw a soulful crowd as it is the first festival after the death of Zabalaza co-founder and co-ordinator Zoleka Helesi last year. Baxter chief executive and artistic director, Lara Foot, said: “The tragic passing of Zoleka last year left a huge void, not only to her friends and colleagues from the Zabalaza and Baxter teams, but also for the arts in South Africa.” For its 11th edition, this year’s Zabalaza Challenge will once again allow the public to make a significant impact on the festival and artists involved. The challenge, initiated by Foot in 2018, encourages individuals, businesses, and organisations to join her in purchasing bulk tickets at only R30 each in support of those who might not be able to afford them or would not otherwise be able to attend. “The festival has empowered so many young theatre-makers who otherwise might not have had the opportunity to have their work seen or acknowledged. “I invite you to join me in buying bulk tickets and creating an opportunity for young artists and audiences,” said Foot. Due to the lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic, this year’s festival was innovatively conceptualised by the Zabalaza team, with a range of supporting mini-festivals held at The Baxter in January, and a script-writing programme introduced from August to October 2020. Zabalaza artistic director Mdu Kweyama said: “It was quite clear from the mini-festivals that the new approach to the script development process and mentors working closely with the writers at an early stage resulted in works of an exceptionally high standard.” Cape Argus
