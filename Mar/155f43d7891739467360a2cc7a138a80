The article by Lorenzo A Davids refers, “#changethestory: Fix the system and we fix the infrastructure”: by Rob Johnston Thank you for another insightful and accurate article from Lorenzo Davids. His description of the political situation shows clearly that the “Goliath” party has nothing to fear from a lot of little “Davids”. How sad then to see on the opposite letters page two letters from separate small parties. Both correspondents have often appeared on previous letters pages, making sensible and relevant points (usually), and I’m sure both have the respect and support of their respective groups. I’m also sure that those groups represent largish sections of Cape Town’s population, but they unfortunately dwindle into insignificance on a national scale, and will never have any political clout, as Lorenzo Davids explains. I’m no political expert, but would love to see a coalition which could stand up to “Goliath”, and it would certainly prove that we could rise above the artificial divisions in humankind. Maybe we should all be lending support to the CapExit movement to reclaim some relevance in this beautiful Cape? * Rob Johnston, Tokai. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
