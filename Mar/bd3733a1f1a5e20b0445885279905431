Cape Town - Hawk’s members came the rescue of an elderly man who was travelling from Cape Town to Johannesburg after he had an accident. SAPS said that the 70-year-old man had had the accident near Strydenburg in the Karoo when the Hawks members – whose names were not released – en route to De Aar, stopped and assisted him. The man then wrote a letter to the Northern Cape Head of Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Major General Kholekile Galawe, thanking him for what his members did. On the commendation letter, he said: “It often takes a crisis to reveal the best in people and it is with this in mind that I write to you to congratulate you on two of your remarkable staff members.” “They arrived on the scene, it was as if two Hawks had swooped down like Angels from Heaven,” he continued. “In that moment of crisis, I was ably supported by two remarkable men, intelligent, considerate and clearly skilled at managing a crisis”. Although the vehicle was written off during the accident, the driver whose name is withheld by the Hawks did not sustain any injuries has received support from the Hawks members, even after the accident. Galawe thanked the Hawks members and expressed his pride in having members of their calibre in his command. Cape Argus
