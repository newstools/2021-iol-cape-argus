by JS Trakman With the move of WP Rugby to the new Cape Town Stadium, nothing much has been written about what will replace Newlands. The space should not be lost to entertainment, post Covid-19. The City is in dire need of a multi-purpose indoor venue with capacity for up to 15Â 000, for concerts, boxing, tennis tournaments etc. The Good Hope Centre is seldom used and its acoustics render it a white elephant. Also Cape Town could be reinvented as a stop on the ATP Tennis calender and thereby reintroduce a tennis culture in the city. Could this not be funded by the demolition of the GH Centre and replaced with low-cost housing. The new Entertainment Centre could be run much like the Convention Centre and maybe funded by another small casino with residential and offices included? Is this not a viable option? * JS Trakman, Sea Point. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
