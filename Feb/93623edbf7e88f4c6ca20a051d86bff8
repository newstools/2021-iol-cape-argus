Cape Town - The City of Cape Town is calling on expectant mothers to make use of free antenatal services and care at its clinics. This comes as the nationwide awareness campaign, Pregnancy Education Week, kicked off on February 13. The  campaign runs until February 21. Mayco member for community services and health Zahid Badroodien said: “It is important that women receive antenatal care as soon as they find out they are pregnant, preferably before 14 weeks of pregnancy. “This helps to ensure the pregnancy and birth is a positive experience. It is also salient that her partner, a close friend or family member, accompany her on antenatal care visits and support her during the pregnancy and labour.” The City’s health department recorded 20 655 basic antenatal care (BANC) visits during the 2018/2019 financial year, which increased to 22 504 visits the following year. Antenatal care services at public health clinics come at no cost, and the City health department encourages all pregnant mothers to attend all antenatal appointments,  which are scheduled every four weeks for 28 weeks of pregnancy, then every two weeks up to 36 weeks, and thereafter weekly until delivery. It says should an expectant mother experience any of the following symptoms: abdominal pain (not discomfort); blurred vision; liquid (amniotic fluid) leaking from the vagina; persistent headache; reduced foetal (baby) movements; and vaginal bleeding, she should return to the clinic immediately for a check-up. Expectant mothers are urged to stay healthy and remain physically active for a safe pregnancy and to abstain from smoking cigarettes, illegal drug use and consuming alcohol, as this could compromise the birth, and endanger the life of, the baby.
