Congratulations are in order as AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, confirmed his engagement to the “love of his life” Nelli Tembe. The “All Eyes On Me” hitmaker hinted at the proposal on Monday, with a cute snap of a diamond band on Tembe’s ring finger. His initial Twitter post had not said much to confirm if he really popped the question. Supa Mega later took to Instagram to confirm he was officially off the market. He reposted the image with the ring, revealing the engagement date as Sunday, February 21, and the caption just melted everyone’s heart. He wrote: “21/02/21 - love of my life said Yesssss. 💍” A post shared by AKA (@akaworldwide) The love birds have been dating for just over a year and it seems they are well on their way to the alter. Fans and industry friends, including Khuli Chana, DJ Sbu and Lootlove, flooded AKA’s timeline with congratulatory messages. “Congratulations man 💫💫💫,” commented rapper Yanga Chief. “Congratulations my brother,” wrote singer J'Something. “Congratulations brother. God speed 💯,” said veteran radio personality DJ Sbu. AKA revealed his relationship with Tembe months after his public break up with his baby mama, Ntombezinhle ‘DJ Zinhle’ Jiyane. It is believed the rapper ended his relationship with DJ Zinhle in December, barely a year after rekindling their romance. In an interview on Metro FM, he said: “It’s been a crazy start to the year, I had to go away. “I went on holiday. I was just speaking off-air that I went on a very cold holiday. As people might have noticed it’s my first holiday being a single man for many, many years,” said AKA at the time. In March 2020, Twitter dragged DJ Zinhle for taking the rapper back after a photo of the two kissing went viral. According to reports, AKA broke up with DJ Zinhle because there were too many people meddling in their relationship. Meanwhile, the rapper recently dropped the long awaited music video for his new single off the Bhovamania EP, “Finessin”. His single, “Energy”, recently reached gold status.
