Following the overwhelling response to “Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical”, the Shondaland breakout series “Bridgerton” seems to be next for the musical treatment. Earlier this year, following the runway Netflix original hit series’ debut, TikTok creator and singer Abigail Barlow had the bright idea to turn “Bridgerton” into a musical. Barlow first went to work on the now infamous “I Burn for You” scene featuring Lady Daphne Bridgerton, Duchess of Hastings (Phoebe Dynevor) and Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page). “Burn For You” quickly became an instant hit on the video-sharing app with various creators dueting Barlow taking over the FYPs (For You Pages) of “Bridgerton” fans on the app. Excuse the spit sounds let’s hear some Simons!  🥰✨ If u need reference go check out the original tiktok! ##bridgertonmusical ##duet with @abigailbarlowww my formal application to be the duke of bridgertontok. ##singing ##bridgerton ##simon ##duet with @abigailbarlowww I had to do another one I’m so obsessed ##bridgerton ##bridgertonmusical ##simon ##singing Barlow continued developing the musical and roped in Emily Bear who she was working with on a different musical and the two women seem to be making magic.

The duo also recently spoke to Variety and in the interview Barlow and Bear revealed that a concept album and Broadway musical are in the works. “We have a lot of different options right now, because not only have people been paying attention, but now also the executives are paying attention,” Bear said. “We’re trying to keep our wits about us and finish the project as well, just so that we have something solid to share with people,” Barlow adds. “But the dream, of course, would be Broadway. Wouldn’t that be nice, if the world opened back up and we could put on ’Bridgerton: The Musical’?”
