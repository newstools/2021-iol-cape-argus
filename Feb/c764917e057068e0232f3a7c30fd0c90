CAPE TOWN - Olympic champion Wayde van Niekerk is passionate about making a difference with mental health projects and nutritional education after being announced as a Laureus ambassador on Monday. Van Niekerk is one of a horde of South African sporting stars who are part of the global sports development charity, including Bryan Habana, Lucas Radebe and Desiree Ellis. The 28-year-old 400m world-record holder himself was born as a premature baby at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, and is determined to help communities in need. The Laureus Sport for Good charity uses sport to assist young people who are faced with violence, discrimination and disadvantage, and has contributed to more than 200 programmes in over 40 countries. “I’m honoured to be a part of the Laureus family, joining an esteemed group of sports men and women who are members and ambassadors of this great global organisation,” Van Niekerk said in a statement on Monday.
