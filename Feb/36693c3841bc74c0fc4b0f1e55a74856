It is with sincere thanks that we pen this letter, five weeks after we lost our daughter, sister, wife and mother. There are no words to fully express our heartfelt gratitude to one and all who assisted at this trying time. On Saturday, December 19, while hiking up Table Mountain with her husband and two daughters, Zarina Talia collapsed and tragically passed away. To the paramedic couple, doctor and fellow hikers who were at the scene – your kindness, comfort and all your efforts will not be forgotten. We thank: Table Mountain Rescue Air Mercy Services Wilderness Search and Rescue Police Services To the mortuary services – for your prompt service in ensuring that the autopsy was done within hours, despite it being the weekend. Muslim Burial Services Anna Els – Social Development Co-ordinator in Kalk Bay. Friends and family from Cape Town as well as holidaymakers from Joburg who came to the site to render assistance to the family. To one and all for all the moral support, prayers, calls, messages and comfort that was extended to the family. Most importantly we give thanks to The Almighty for bringing all you beautiful people together to assist us. * The Talia family, Johannesburg. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
