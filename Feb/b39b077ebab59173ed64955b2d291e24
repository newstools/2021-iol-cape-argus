Cape Town – The Durbanville Children’s Home is appealing to the public to become a volunteer at the home, to assist in providing an extra pair of helping hands. The non-profit child and youth care centre is inviting all those interested in becoming a volunteer to attend a volunteer information session on Monday, February 22 at 6.30pm. Volunteers are needed and will be assisting in the Charity shop, bookshop as well as to assist the children with homework. Charity shop volunteers will be required to work about four hours a week, once per week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays or Friday from 10am to 3pm or Saturday from 10am to 12.30pm. Book shop volunteers are required to work about two hours per week from Monday to Friday. Support Services manager Yvonne Mathieson said: “Currently, we have a large need for volunteers to assist with education as most of our children are only attending school every second day due to the Covid-19 regulations. We are looking for volunteers who are willing to assist our children with school work Monday-Friday either from 9am–11am or in the afternoons from 3pm–5pm. We want to do everything that we can to ensure that our children have as much educational assistance as possible so that they do not fall behind.” Volunteers will be screened, with references checked and police clearances done. Durbanville Children’s Home provides care for 144 children, with therapeutic and development programmes, counselling and reintegration into family and community services rendered. The Home has also appealed to the public to donate masks for the children aged three to 18 years, as well as vitamins and other medical supplies. Those who will be attending the information session are kindly requested to email volunteer@durbanvillekinderhuis.org.za so as to ensure that all Covid-19 protocols are in place, prior to arrival.
