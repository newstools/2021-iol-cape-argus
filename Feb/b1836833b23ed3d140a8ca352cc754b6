DURBAN - Does Jacob Zuma have a favourite piece of clothing? Well, we think so ‚Äì and we have the evidence to back up our theory. During his meeting with Police Minister Bheki Cele today, we spotted Zuma looking sharp in a black long-sleeve shirt with green and brown leaves, and black pants. While we don't have all the details of today's meeting, we believe it could be due to Zuma's refusal to appear before the Zondo Commission. Zuma‚Äôs spokesperson Vukile Mathabela did not respond when asked whether it was an official meeting. But on Twitter, Cele‚Äôs spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, suggested the minister had been sent to Nkandla by the ANC. ‚ÄúMinister Bheki Cele has concluded his visit with former president Jacob Zuma in Nkandla... and will update the ANC leadership on the outcome of his visit first,‚Äù she said. No #NkandlaTea was served but great conversations and laughs were shared amongst Comrades, one of them being, should an arrest warrant be issued, it is the Minster that would come and fetch @PresJGZuma ü§£ pic.twitter.com/ddFuAoC2TN  But when pictures of the meeting between Zuma and Cele appeared on social media, we knew there was something oddly familiar about the former president‚Äôs outfit. Scroll back a few days and you'll remember Zuma's ‚Äútea party‚Äù with EFF leader Julius Malema that left many people confused about why Malema would want to have a sit down with Zuma, especially after the #ZuptaMustFall and #PayBackTheMoney rhetoric previously spouted by the EFF.

Social media users also noticed that he was seen wearing the same shirt during a meeting with Cassper Nyovest (real name Refiloe Maele Phoolo). Apparently that meeting took place on Monday.  The eNkandla National Keypoint is busy these days...we like itCheck this greeting! üî• pic.twitter.com/ymoZfLgQ3C  IOL
