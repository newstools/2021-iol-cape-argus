Cape Town - A Durban-based businessman allegedly linked to the supply of firearms to gangsters in the Western Cape appeared in the Worcester Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The case against the gun dealer from Merewent has been postponed until later this week. Anderson Padayachee faces 61 charges, including eight counts of murder, five counts of attempted murder, money laundering, fraud, modifying firearms, selling or supplying firearms, failure to keep registers, failure to submit weekly returns and failure to produce firearm inspection reports. According to National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila, the case against Padayachee has been postponed until February 18 for a bail application. The Hawks’ National Bureau for Illegal Firearms Control and Priority Violent Crime (NBIFCPVC) from Cape Town, along with a special task force in Durban, Crime Intelligence and metro police, arrested Padayachee on Friday. Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani said the 41-year-old gun shop owner had been linked to the supply of firearms through a separate investigation. She said the Hawks-led team seized 17 illegal firearms in George in transit from Johannesburg. Investigations had revealed that the seized firearms were allegedly destined for criminal gangs in Cape Town. Hani said another 44 firearms were seized from the suspect’s business. “A further forensic examination allegedly linked some of the firearms to criminal activities ranging from murder and attempted murder,” she said.
