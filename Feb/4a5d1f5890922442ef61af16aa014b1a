Cape Town - A goodwill movement founded in an effort to recognise and support healthcare workers across the country has gained traction, with different communities joining in. #HospitalHeroes, as it is fondly known by participants, has finally managed to garner support from corporate giants. The movement, which began running in partnership with Gift of the Givers South Africa at the six district hospitals in the Western Cape, on Monday saw asset management company Allan Gray come on board and support its efforts to raise funds to be able to buy refreshments to distribute to medical staff at hospitals, to lift the spirits of doctors, nurses and support staff. Staff at Allan Gray created and launched an initiative called “Do Good” to raise funds and donations for Gift of the Givers in the name of Hospital Heroes. The funds raised from the initiative were matched by Allan Gray. Allan Gray chief operating Officer Rob Formby said: “At Allan Gray, we support our staff who raise funds for worthy causes by matching their donations. We recognise the critical role healthcare workers are playing in fighting the pandemic, and the donation was just a small way to show our gratitude.” Cape Argus Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
