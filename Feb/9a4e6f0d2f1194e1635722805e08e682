Tamara Snow Online dating can feel like a mixed bag of crazy sometimes, but it doesn’t need to be. If you’re clear on what you’re looking for in a partner and know what qualities are important to you, you may just find ‘the one’ or whoever it is that you’re looking for. I started online dating in the year that shall not be named (2020), with no hint of a meaningful connection in sight. When lockdown began I decided to take matters into my own hands by launching an online dating experiment on Instagram called Love Online, to explore whether a meaningful connection could be found in the online space. Months later and from personal experience I can confidently say that it can be! Here are my top tips for a meaningful connection online: Be honest with yourself! What are you looking for? A summer romance, a fling, ‘the one’? List the qualities you’d like in that special someone. Once you have a good idea of these qualities, let me tell you a truth - there is a slim chance that one person will tick off that entire list, but that doesn’t mean you have to settle. My advice? Narrow your list down to your non-negotiables. What is really important to you? Be yourself! You’ve worked so hard to be the person you are and you should be proud of that! Upload a recent image of yourself (no photos older than a year and no filters!) Make sure your bio is true to who you are, not who you think someone may find interesting. For more insights on how to navigate the online dating world tune into my Facebook Live discussion on the Cape Argus’ page tonight at 19h30. Bring those burning questions with you and let’s see if we can help you find a meaningful connection in the online space. * Watch Tamara’s virtual dating experiment on her YouTube channel or on Instagram @IAmTamaraSnow.
