Cape Town – Police have called on Kraaifontein residents to come forward with information regarding a suspected gang-related incident involving minors in Watsonia Park, Scottsdene, on Saturday morning. According to a witness who did not want to be named for his safety, on Saturday, while on his way to a nearby shop, he spotted two young boys armed with a gun, attempting to shoot at another young boy. He said: “I was standing a few metres away when I heard one of the boys instruct the other to get inside the yard and shoot. “The gun did not go off, I suspect that it jammed or something. However, that was not the end of it, as they were running away they shouted, ‘We are from Carmen Street and we will find you and next time we will kill you’. “I was not hurt but the incident shook me because they were just children. We have a young child at home, the same age as those two, and I’m worried about him and his future, it feels like all I have is a prayer to keep him safe.” Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said while no formal report had been called in, police were aware there was currently a post on social media related to a shooting incident in Watsonia Park doing the rounds. “We encourage any victims or anyone with information surrounding the illegal possession of firearms to contact Kraaifontein detectives on 082 469 3319 to open a case for investigation so that the perpetrator(s) can be brought to book.” Kraaifontein Community Development Forum secretary Louis Botha said: “We are opposed to all forms of criminal activity and we are asking all community members to be vigilant and report incidents of crime. We firmly believe that it is only through community involvement that we will be able to combat these incidents of violence.” Cape Argus
