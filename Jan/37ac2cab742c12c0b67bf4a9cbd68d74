Cape Town - Concerned about rising coronavirus infections in the province, Cape Town civil society organisations are sharing detailed Covid-19 personal experiences in an effort to urge the public to observe and adhere to alert level 3 lockdown regulations. Molo Songololo director Patrick Solomons, who was admitted to hospital on December 31 after contracting the virus, has urged residents to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Solomons said that while he and his colleagues had observed health and safety protocols they had still unknowingly contracted the virus. “The message is that you can never be sure. We all must continue to wear masks properly, sanitise and wash hands regularly, stay home, and don't invite people over. “So many people are dying, and we can slow it down if everyone plays their part. Businesses, shops and public transport operators must be held accountable for ensuring adherence to Covid-19 protocols. Stay away from crowded places and events. It will save your life,” said Solomons. A Hout Bay-based organisation, the 790 Covid-19 Reaction Team, has called on people to help inspire hope among health-care workers. The team has launched a campaign in support of health-care workers and will work to raise funds to purchase over 2 000 immune boosters for front-line health-care workers. Co-ordinator Roscoe Jacobs said: “There is a need to support our health-care workers, instead of depending on the government to look out for them. We wish to support at least 2 000 health-care workers with a monthly supply of immune boosters. “Adhering to the Covid-19 regulations is imperative. We must play our part to minimise the risk of contracting and spreading the virus. This will assist our health-care workers. Through adhering, we also protect ourselves and our loved ones,” said Jacobs. Cape Argus
