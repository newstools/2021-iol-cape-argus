Cape Town - The citizen engagement platform used by the South African government, GovChat, has applied to the Competition Tribunal to prevent Facebook from removing it from the WhatsApp platform. The application was filed during an urgent hearing of the Tribunal held yesterday, Wednesday, morning. This follows a disagreement with Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, over an alleged violation of the contractual terms of use by GovChat. GovChat argued before the tribunal that it had made numerous failed attempts to reach a commercial solution for all stakeholders, with Facebook, to prevent the termination of GovChat’s access to the WhatsApp platform. Tribunal spokesperson Gillian de Gouveia said: “Founder and CEO of GovChat Eldrid Jordaan has asked the Tribunal to interdict and restrain Facebook from off-boarding them from the WhatsApp platform pending the outcome of a complaint which they submitted to the Competition Commission, relating to alleged prohibited practices by Facebook, or for a period of six months, whichever occurs first.” GovChat said: “After the Covid-19 outbreak GovChat diverted to assisting the government with Covid-19 education and awareness, symptom tracking, the provision of test results and enabling citizens to apply for urgent social relief grants/distress grants.” Facebook meanwhile argues that the case concerns its rights to enforce the contractual terms that govern the use of its paid business messaging platform, the WhatsApp business application programming interface, which connects third parties to the platform. Facebook has accused GovChat of breaching the terms of use in pursuit of commercial interests. GovChat claims that it operates within WhatsApp’s terms of use, has never intentionally misrepresented its position and acted in good faith at all times. In the appeal Jordaan argues that Facebook’s removal of GovChat from WhatsApp’s API will: “End GovChat’s ability to render services to the government and citizens at the height of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa and force the applicants out of business.” Approached for comment, Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) spokesperson Paseka Maleka said: “The matter falls outside of the authority’s jurisdiction.” Cape Argus
