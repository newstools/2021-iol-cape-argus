Cape Town – A number of of communities in Cape Town are fuming about the City’s decision to discontinue their mobile libraries without informing them. Pinelands Ratepayers Association chairperson and Thornton Community Police Forum chairperson John Berry said he was “disgusted” to learn about the plans via a secondary source, and not from the City. “The City continually takes away essential services in local communities and does not replace them with permanent solutions. It is sad, disgusting and completely unacceptable. Residents who do not have cars, and children, will be left in the cold should the City not be stopped from making yet another terrible blunder that disregards people’s needs,” Berry said. Heinz Park community activist Tashreeq Perry said he was disappointed that what he thought was a temporary measure had ended with the libraries being phased out with no permanent replacement in sight. “I learnt to read in the bus library that used to come every week into our community. It was the closest thing to a library most of the residents in my community have known for years. Despite talks about us finally receiving a library of our own, we are having to come to terms with having no access at all to such an essential service,” he said. “It’s very frustrating that we are expected to go to neighbouring communities to make use of libraries instead of us finally having our own one built.” Heinz Park, Thornton, Mandalay, Ruyterwacht, Schotsche Kloof and Elfindale were among 28 communities serviced by the City’s mobile libraries. Mayco member for community services and health Zahid Badroodien said the mobile service had been plagued by maintenance issues. “Of our fleet of three, two of the buses have more than 30 years of service, with the third one being relatively new and in service since 2014. “It is very unfortunate that we cannot continue the service due to factors such as the ageing fleet,” he said.
