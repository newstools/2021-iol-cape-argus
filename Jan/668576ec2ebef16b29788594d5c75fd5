Cape Town - Former Cape Argus photographer Enver Essop died at the age of 54 on Tuesday after contracting Covid-19. His janaaza (funeral) was at the Masjied Ghiedmatiel Islamia in Rondebosch. Essop worked for several news publications, including Die Burger, the Cape Argus and the Cape Times. He was described by colleagues as a “gentle giant”. Independent Media editor-in-chief Aneez Salie said: “I am saddened by the news. It was a pleasure working with Enver, nothing was too far for him. It is a reminder to our colleagues to be cautious and to take this virus seriously.” Salie was the Cape Times night news editor at the time he worked closely with Essop. Photographer Ian Landsberg said: “Very few of the Argus photographers had the ability to capture the nuances of township life. He was a passionate photographer and he captured stories that you could really feel. He took his time when he went out on jobs to really capture an image and tell a beautiful story.” Essop had 13 years’ experience as a press photographer. He was a well known wedding photographer as well. Essop began getting a fever over the weekend, which persisted. A former colleague who worked in the photographic development department at the Cape Argus, Baartie Kafaar, worked closely with Essop for five years and described him as “soft spoken”. “He had a very soft heart, he enjoyed life and he was very committed to his craft. He never rushed while working and was just there to do a good job. He always sent me messages, wished me for my birthday. I was very shocked when I heard about his death.” Cape Argus acting deputy editor Quinton Mtyala worked with Essop when he was still an intern. “He was very nice and a very dedicated person, you would never hear him in the office, never shouted and never got angry.” Essop is survived by his wife Philda and two children, aged 20 and 5.
