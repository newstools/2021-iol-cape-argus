Cape Town - Robben Island Museum has cancelled plans to host its annual Valentine’s Day wedding ceremony in adherence to the directive by the Department of Home Affairs. This came after the announcement made by Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi about the temporary suspension of applications for IDs, passports and marriage licences because of the increase in Department of Home Affairs staff testing positive for Covid-19. Robben Island Museum spokesperson Morongoa Ramaboa said: “This year would have marked 21 years of celebrating love on the Island. Last year we had 19 couples tie the knot at the museum, with a historic milestone of Frankford Williams and Cindi Mullins, who are visually impaired, officially being the first couple in South Africa to receive their marriage certificate in braille. “It is no doubt that this year would have been something special as well, but unfortunately due to the pandemic we are battling as a country and measures have been put in place to counter the spread of Covid-19 and we have to adhere to them.” To date, Robben Island Museum has played host to 327 weddings because of a fruitful partnership between the Museum and the Department of Home Affairs. “Although this year’s Valentines’s Day weddings have been cancelled, Robben Island Museum and the Department of Home Affairs will continue to engage on the possibility of hosting the weddings at a later stage, should conditions allow with the easing of Covid-19 regulations,”  Ramaboa said.
