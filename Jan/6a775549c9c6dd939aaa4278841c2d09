The article, “Outrage over SA’s plan to vaccinate prisoners first before ordinary citizens” refers: If we needed confirmation that the inmates are running the asylum, it comes in the news that the government intends to vaccinate prisoners first. These people are murderers, rapists, thieves and wrongdoers of every sort. That they should take precedence over the courageous, law-abiding citizens and the elderly is an outrage. I hope there will be vociferous protests about this and the ANC will have to retract this heinous intention. * J.M Chipkin, Fresnaye. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
