Cape Town - Irate Mitchells Plain residents and People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) are determined to send a firm message to drug dealers, that they will not condone the breakdown of their community through the illegal drug trade. On Saturday evening, a group of 50 people consisting of residents and Pagad members gathered in Westridge, Mitchells Plain, for prayer and to confront an alleged drug dealer in the area. Pagad member Zoghrah Kriel said she was approached by a few members of the community on Saturday, requesting Pagad intervention. “The complaint is that a person living in the area is dealing in drugs. He is not dealing from his house but a nearby section known as 'Die Bos' as I'm told,” she said. “A concerned member of this community had an altercation with him last week where he pulled a knife on him. Thus the reason he called on Pagad. We will not tolerate seeing our kids get lured into drugs because of their greed. Strange elements are increasing in the community and members of the community want to nip it in the butt.” She said they are aware of more drug dealers in the area, but due to the current Covid-19 restrictions in place, they went to the home of only one. “No doubt the message will filter through to the others,” she said. Pagad national co-ordinator Haroon Orrie said at the gathering that the problem of rampant drug use was not getting better in any community. “Yes, people differ with our methodology, (but) we believe in a divine right to defend ourselves. Whether we believe in the Bible, the Torah, the Qur’an, it doesn't matter. God has given each and everyone a divine right to defend yourself,” said Orrie. “People don’t like violence, we don’t like violence, but we have to defend at any costs because life is sacred.” Cape Argus
