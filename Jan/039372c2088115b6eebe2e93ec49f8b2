Cape Town - The City of Cape Town says it has met with the Cape of Good Hope SPCA regarding the male baboon known as Kataza. It was concerned about Kataza’s raiding behaviour, and alternative solutions were being discussed as the baboon had failed to integrate with his natal Slangkop troop in the Kommetjie area since returning there on November 12, the City said. Initially, Kataza was removed from his Slangkop troop in August and relocated to Tokai. It caused a public outcry from animal rights activists and the public and led to court action. There was also a social media campaign called “Bring Kataza Back”. The City said Kataza was being monitored and during the past two days he moved from Capri to Da Gama and had on occasion tried crossing Ou Kaapseweg towards Tokai. It said should he reach Tokai on his own by January 11, he will be afforded the opportunity to integrate and his raiding behaviour will be monitored. Further intervention will be required should Kataza not reach Tokai by Monday, the City said and added it would seek a permit from the SPCA to have Kataza translocated to a rehabilitation centre in Limpopo. The public will be kept informed about any developments. Residents are encouraged to call the baboon hotline 071 588 6540 should they experience any related incidents. African News Agency (ANA)
