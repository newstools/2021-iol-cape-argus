It’s becoming increasingly difficult to comprehend the thinking behind the ban from beaches during the new level 3 lockdown. Driving from Hout Bay through to Camps Bay, every single restaurant and coffee shop, particularly in Camps Bay, is filled to capacity with people sitting on top of each other, no masks, no physical distancing. So now the restaurants are overflowing, as are the shopping centres, while the beaches where the sea air would be blowing the virus away from any infected person and people would be lying prone in the sand tanning is a high Covid risk ? Let us remember that the Covid virus as with all other viruses is stationary. It doesn’t move around, humans do the moving around. Human beings are simply the hosts that keep the virus alive. Without the movement of people there would in fact be no Covid. Theoretically if people stood still for five days the virus would be wiped out. It’s not rocket science, but simple logic yet people sit hustled around a table laughing, talking and spitting into the air passing the virus around like a game of spin the bottle. By shutting the beaches down the authorities simply herded people into overcrowded restaurants and the rest is history. Had the beaches been open then half the people sitting and spitting at each other in restaurants would be lying on the beach. The authorities got it wrong and need to rectify the situation by lifting the ban on beaches and in so doing reduce the influx of people flooding into restaurants and spreading the virus. * Colin Bosman, Newlands. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
