Corona, an enemy we despise People will die like flies If they do not listen to our desperate pleas and cries, "sanitise, mask and stay far away. To keep Corona at bay" Stop the hugging To stop Corona's fatal mugging. If you think it's okay To foolishly disobey By treating  this virus like tea, And ignoring society's urgent plea, Then,  you, me and your family, Corona will take us by surprise To our early demise. Heed the call Before you fall, Because the request is small For a reward that is tall. This isn't fake, So for humanity's sake Small sacrifices you must make, Before we have more dead bodies than our graves can take. Gucci and Carducci Won't help, so don't yelp. It's a story I didn't make; It's a serious mistake To treat this as fake Because you will die Before you can say goodbye. * EV Rapit, KENWYN. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
