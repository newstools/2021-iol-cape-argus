Cape Town - Police in Steenberg are still searching for three suspects who orchestrated an armed robbery at a local Retreat community clinic shortly after midnight on Saturday. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said a case of armed robbery is currently under investigation by Steenberg police following an incident on Sunday morning in 11th Ave Cafda Village, Steenberg. “Two people who were at the clinic during the incident were robbed of their cellphones and cash by three unknown suspects. No one have been arrested yet.” Chairperson of the Retreat Community Health Centre Health Committee, Henry Moses, said: “We are very disappointed to see that the clinic has been robbed for a second time. As a community, we need to rally together to show that we will no longer tolerate this behaviour. It is not right that staff and security must endure this type of behaviour.” Retreat Steenberg Civic Association chairperson Mark Solomons said: “We want to make it clear that we condemn what happened at our clinic. We are in the process of partnering with the facility in their efforts to strengthen and sustain security measures, and appeal to our community to roll up their sleeves and join us in doing so. Without this facility in our community, many members of our community will suffer.” Meanwhile, the Western Cape Government of Health has strongly condemned the incident, saying that the situation had been handed over to authorities. Spokesperson Mark van der Heever said: “The matter has been reported to the authorities and services have since resumed. We are deeply distressed at the criminal attack on our security staff and community members, as this continues to add additional psychological trauma and strain on our staff, who continue to fight the pandemic during this second wave of Covid-19.” Cape Argus
