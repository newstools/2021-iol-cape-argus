Cape Town - A group of TS Woltemade sea cadets were given a special matric farewell during a recent dinner their families also attended. With 2020 having been a year unlike any other, the event was “intended to close the loop and avoid this group feeling that they have been ‘kicked out of the nest’ without a goodbye,” TS Woltemade executive officer Gaylene Pillay said. “2020 posed unique challenges for sea cadets, adult officers and instructors as the family was separated due to the lockdown. The unit successfully utilised online creative projects to stay in contact with the sea cadets via technology and set many interesting practical tasks for them to complete at home. Projects were submitted via cell phone on photo or video format,” Pillay said. Some cadets had spent five years at the unit. A three course dinner for the cadets and their immediate families was served. Senior sea cadets shared just how much the TS Woltemade and being a cadet had impacted on their lives. Cadets were given service certificates and testimonials from TS Woltemade. “This was the first time TS Woltemade had celebrated an occasion like this and we trust it is the start of a new tradition. As the long-standing executive officer of TS Woltemade, I am indeed proud to be sending such good quality young people out into the world to create a positive ripple,” Pillay said. Cape Argus
