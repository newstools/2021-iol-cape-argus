Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has turned to pleading with residents to assist in reporting those who vandalise and break City infrastructure. This after a report by the local government uncovered several shocking incidents seemingly directed at City infrastructure and staff. Mayco Member for Water and Waste Xanthea Limberg said the damage to City infrastructure was causing serious service delivery delays, but the City had taken a stance to set its working staff’s safety as a priority. In a statement, the City said over the past month, three sewer pump stations in Heinz Park, Durbanville and Philippi West were vandalised while in Monwabisi Park, a team was robbed at gunpoint while working to bring water supply to an informal settlement in the community. “On Monday, January 18, three criminals approached three members of our staff, who were on-site in Monwabisi Park to oversee work being done by contractors. The team was held at gunpoint, robbed of their personal items, as well as two City radios and tools. Our team was left in a trench as the criminals made their escape, in a City-hired bakkie. “We condemn these actions in the strongest terms and we cannot tolerate opportunistic criminals placing our staff’s lives at risk, who are there to deliver services to residents and improve living conditions. We are relieved to know that none of our staff were physically injured but this has been a traumatic experience for them, and as such, they are receiving trauma counselling.” “The City will continue to clear sewer blockages and overflows as soon as possible. In the meantime, the City is investigating contingency measures where possible, while prioritising the safety of our staff and infrastructure, as well as the well-being of our residents,” said Limberg.
