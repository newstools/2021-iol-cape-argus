Cape Town - The legislature’s public accounts committee has given organisations and individual members of the public until tomorrow to have their say on the provincial government’s annual reports ahead of hearings beginning next Monday. In an advert published in the Saturday edition of the Weekend Argus, committee chairperson Lulama Mvimbi (ANC) said: “At these meetings only parts ‘C’ and ‘E’, which deal with  governance and financial information respectively, of the annual reports will be discussed.” Mvimbi added: “Interested persons and organisations are invited to attend and participate in these meetings through the Microsoft Teams platform or to follow proceedings on YouTube. “Those with an interest should submit their written or oral comments on the annual reports of the Western Cape government and its entities by email or as WhatsApp voice notes and messages to the number 078 155 5461. Emails should be addressed to the committee’s procedural officer, Dustin Davids, at ddavids@wcpp.gov.za,” said Mvimbi. “Those making submissions in this way must include their full name, subject matter, email address and/or contact number. Submissions must reach Davids by Tuesday, January 19,” said Mvimbi. Davids said: “Electronic versions of the annual reports are available on the legislature’s website (www.wcpp.gov.za). I can also be contacted for a copy of the schedule of the committee meetings and the YouTube links for the meetings.” The annual reports will involve briefings by the auditor-general and the audit committee on the audit outcome of the annual reports of all 11 departments, including the office of the premier.
