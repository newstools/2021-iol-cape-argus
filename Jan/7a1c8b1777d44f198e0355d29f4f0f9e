Cape Town - Community-based organisations are rallying to source back-to-school stationery packs for disadvantaged children. In the wake of the Covid-19 resurgence, the underprivileged have been hit hard once again. With just a few weeks before schools reopen, organisations are rallying to support children whose parents have lost their income due to the coronovirus crisis. However, with many sponsors suffering from donor fatigue, donations are trickling in slowly. Khayelitsha Community Policing Forum chairperson Phindile George said they had been campaigning for donations but stationery packs were coming in slowly. In Kraaifontein, a popular youth initiative, the Restoration Youth Development Program, said the need for support was growing daily, despite its limited resources. Founder Terence Crowster said when they decided to host the back-to-school donation drive in celebration of its Hotspot Library’s five-year anniversary this year, it did not anticipate the overwhelming need for support. “In honour of our anniversary this year we wanted to give back to our community by supporting children who often are the most vulnerable and have been left even more so by this pandemic. “I know of several families that have been hit hard by this pandemic. This is why we decided to extend our efforts. Over the years we have hosted several feeding-scheme initiatives and after-school programmes. This year we wanted to do more and support our children with what they need most, stationery supplies. “Supporting our children and uplifting our community is something that’s close to my heart and we would welcome any support we can get. Nowadays our children have a lot to shoulder, and if we can make one aspect of their lives a little easier the world will be a better place,” Crowster said. Cape Argus
