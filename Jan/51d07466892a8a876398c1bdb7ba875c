by Peter Neil Hendricks On speaking to a recently retired teacher, the feeling was one of joy and happiness.  This time of the year educators are normally anticipating the opening of schools - under normal circumstances. At any school there are always challenges... some you can control, and others you can't. In retirement you don’t worry about these challenges of what the term holds for you. At home, you think about your ex-colleagues. The one big challenge for schools is how to receive learners back from their drawn-out holiday. Were these returning learners exposed to Covid 19 or not, is the thinking. Educators at home are already starting to think of the challenges. For the whole day they must tell learners how to wear their masks... keep your distance.... don’t rub your eyes or put your hand in your mouth. You must motivate them to focus on their school work while you, as an educator, are also so scared and not motivated. The first day of school and you wish it is holiday again. The constant worry if you are going to be next in contracting the virus. Your mind and anxiety levels are high. You worry that maybe you are next. At night you can't sleep... you drink prescription drugs to get in some sleep. Where is this all going to end.... Everyone is hoping for a vaccine ... but will life return to normal? Only God knows. * Peter Neil Hendricks, Hanover Park. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
