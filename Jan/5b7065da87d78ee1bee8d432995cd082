Cape Town - An award-winning writer and University of the Western Cape professor is looking forward to publishing his book, Like Fado and Other Stories, early next month. The UWC’s Graham Mort, who is emeritus professor of creative writing and transcultural literature at Lancaster University in the UK, is looking forward to publishing his music-inclined book on February 15. Mort’s book, which was inspired by his travels to Lisbon a few years ago, where he picked up his interest in the musical form of Fado, will feature music-themed tales set around the world from England to Kurdistan, Spain and South Africa. “I did a lot of work on this collection when living in Cape Town and working at UWC. A sense of place is very important to me. Being away from home is always a stimulus to write about home, wherever that may be,” said Mort. “The distance always seems to put things into perspective. So I wrote about South Africa when in England and England when in South Africa, but there were other locations too, like Italy, France, Spain and Kurdistan. So wherever I went I carried my camera and laptop with me.” “I made a visit to Lisbon a few years ago and became interested in the musical form of Fado. The music seems to communicate its emotions so powerfully, and the emotional state of Saudade that underpins Fado music is hard to translate, but it stands for nostalgia, sadness and lost love.” “There is a sense of loss in many of the stories, of 'the road not taken', as the poet Robert Frost put it. But there is a prevailing sense of unreliability too, that the stories people tell are not always truthful or reliable, that we make memories in our own self-image.” “Fado is a Portuguese musical form infused with a sense of sadness, lost love, and nostalgia features in the title story, “Like Fado”, and it sets the mood for many others,” he added.
