by Terrence Grant The problem with the lockdown is that it could eventually result in people dying from the effects of extreme poverty (which include crime, suicide and malnutrition etc). Consequently, the need to salvage as much economic activity as possible, is immeasurably more important than trying to be fair. Simply put, we cannot allow restaurants to go bankrupt in order to ensure that pub-owners feel they are being treated fairly (are not the only ones suffering). Necessity demands that we ask whether the economic benefit of allowing restaurants to sell a few glasses of wine to someone consuming a meal is likely to be outweighed by the negative consequences. A ’one-size-fits all’ approach that focuses on the similarities between restaurants and pubs is likely to have tragic consequences. Similarly, the fact that poor people cannot afford to frequent restaurants should not be allowed to obscure the fact restaurants employ people who come from poor communities and pay taxes that provide the poor with welfare benefits. * Terence Grant, Cape Town. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
