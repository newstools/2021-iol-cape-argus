In response to Ms Ellen Fedele’s letter, ’LETTER: I’d like to repaint the Plumstead subways, but where are the Prasa officials?’: I would like to assure Ms Fedele that we have successfully worked with many communities (including ratepayers’ associations and neighbourhood watches) to help us improve our service offering to commuters. Prasa has always been eager to partner with the communities as we often serve the same communities. It is our view that communities have to take ownership of these facilities and such initiatives are more than welcome. The subway at Plumstead Station is under Prasa management and the nearby other is a City of Cape Town facility providing street to street access. The City is a key and valuable stakeholder and we enjoy a good working relationship. Ms Fedele is welcome to engage the Plumstead Station Manager directly or contact Cyril Bauer (responsible area manager) at cbauer@metrorail.co.za to discuss ideas and options for collaboration. We will consider how these interventions can enhance or augment our own maintenance projects. I look forward to a meaningful and sustained relationship with the residents of Plumstead. * Raymond Maseko, Acting Regional Manager, Metrorail Western Cape. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
