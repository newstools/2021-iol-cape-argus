Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders became an unexpected meme during the U.S. inauguration ceremony on Wednesday, January 20 after being photographed appearing extremely uncomfortable and cold while in his seat. 79-year-old Sanders, who was dressed casually for the festivities donning his signature Burton (snowboarding) jacket with patterned knit mittens and a disposable blue surgical mask, looked pretty grumpy in the cold weather, all alone. A now-iconic photo of a bundled-up Sanders, sitting alone in a folding chair with his arms crossed over his knees, immediately became a hit.
