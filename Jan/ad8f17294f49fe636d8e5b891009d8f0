We all love those transformation challenges. Where women go from scraggly Cinderella to ready-for-the-ball Cinderella by what actually looks like a wave of a magic wand. Add a catchy backing track, like “Don’t Rush” and “Savage Love”, that’s now forever implanted in our brains, and you have an irresistible challenge. The track that has the women gyrating is “Buss It” by rapper Erica Banks. The “Buss It Challenge” starts with women wearing pj’s or sweats, messy hair and no make-up. Then a split second later, with a booty drop, their hair and make-up is on point and sexy revealing outfits suitable for any rap video.
