I want to commend the journalist Sisonke Mlamla for writing a level-headed, honest piece on gun ownership in South Africa and the spike in violent (gun-related) crime we are going through ('How can police root out illegal guns when they are giving those guns to gangs?'). On a deeper reading of the article, one gets the impression that the journalist has actually taken the time and put himself through the rigours of knowing and understanding the fundamentals of the subject matter so that he may know what he is writing about. I must tell you... it is quite refreshing to engage a piece of topical writing at such a level. Unfortunately, such effort by journalists is sorely lacking far too often. So, congratulations and all that other good stuff. Iâ€™ll be looking out for your articles, and I hope this article on the police, gun ownership, crime, rights and duties is one in a series of articles in order to do the subject real justice.
