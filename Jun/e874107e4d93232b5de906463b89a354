Starring as one of the leads in “Fiela se Kind” in 1988, she broke boundaries as a coloured actress in a major film, and became a household name in Egoli: Place of Gold as Ester (Nenna) Willemse. Surtie-Richards went on to star in “7de Laan”, “Generations”, “Villa Rosa” and most recently in the popular Afrikaans kykNet telenovela, “Arendsvlei”. During the early 2000s she also had her own talk show Shaleen on M-Net. She was also a pioneer in theatre, having performed both locally and in the UK in various plays and festivals such as the Grahamstown National Arts Festival and Klein Karoo National Arts festival (KKNK).
