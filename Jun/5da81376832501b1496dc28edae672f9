Cape Town - Today is World Milk Day, and it highlights the multiple benefits that dairy offers. The Western Cape government has joined in on the celebrations by saluting the province’s dairy industry for providing milk, growing the food basket and contributing to South Africa’s economy. The Milk Producer’s Organisation’s March 2021 Dairy Market Trends indicates that dairy exports in 2020 recorded an all-time high. “South Africa exported 460 million litres of milk. These record-breaking exports occurred despite the lockdown restrictions in South Africa. “The Western Cape accounts for 28% of milk production in the country. In terms of exports, the province is a net exporter of milk and cream,” said Agriculture MEC Ivan Meyer. “Milk exports and cream grew at an annual average growth rate of 9% in the past 10 years. Milk is rich in calcium, a mineral that promotes healthy teeth and bones. “The use of milk in food and drink has been happening for thousands of years.” He said that milk is an integral part of most people’s daily lives, and there’s an entire industry that revolves around it as well. “It is also an essential ingredient for dairy foods such as butter, cream, ice cream, and cheese. Milk is often an ingredient used in other foods, such as bread, cakes, cereal, desserts and so much more.” A registered dietitian at Rediscover Dairy, Maretha Vermaak, said: “Milk is a source of valuable nutrients such as good quality protein, naturally occurring sugars and micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals and an array of different fats that support your immune system. “Dairy is a nutritious food that is tasty and convenient to use, any time of the day. Including milk, maas, yoghurt or cheese in your diet will help to ensure that your body gets what it needs.” Meyer added: “With more than 800 million people suffering from hunger worldwide, we have to ensure that a glass of milk reaches our people daily.” Cape Argus
