With regard to “Cape Argus partners with schools for collaborative Book Drive to ignite reading” in your edition of June 15, this is a fantastic initiative and needs to be supported by everyone. Early childhood reading opens up an entire new world to the individual but also equips them to start on the road for a solid foundation for education and thereafter life at work. I recall at the age of three and four my mother not only reading to me but also asking me to identify certain words and to keep repeating them after she had read it. This instilled a love of reading in me and stood me in good stead when I entered primary school. Over and above any homework that I might have received, we were always encouraged to at least read one book per week and then to share the contents with our parents.  Parents play an enormous role which can’t be left entirely to the school. Great strength to Aziz Hartley when he talks about the positive efforts in encouraging reading among others. * Michael Bagraim, Highlands Estate. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
