It is welcome to read on your front page that DF Malan High School realises it is shameful to honour and celebrate the name of the father of apartheid, Prime Minister DF Malan - (DF Malan High School, named after apartheid prime minister, wants name change). All Cape Argus readers wish them goodwill in finding a new, better name. Who is still shameless is the City of Cape Town, who brazenly cling to the name of DF Malan Street â€“ long past its sell-by date. To get the ball rolling, I propose that since this street runs past Artscape, it will be fitting to rename it Johaar Mosaval Street, after District Six's famous ballet dancer. Due to apartheid, he could only fulfil his career abroad. Johaar has received international honours, such as the Queen Elizabeth II medal, so there is no City policy impediment in renaming this street after a living celebrity. What better way to celebrate Africa Day? * Keith Gottschalk, Claremont. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
