Cape Town - Local jazz guitarist Timothy Ehrenreich will launch his recently released debut album at the Zevenbosch Villa at the Zevenwacht Estate on Saturday. The album, created during the unprecedented time of the Covid-19 global pandemic, titled “For Such a Time as This”, will be launched at 6pm and will also feature guest artists Alvin Dyers and Adelia Douw. Ehrenreich said the music was an honest and true reflection of his journey, infused with both local and international influences and represented his heritage, Mitchells Plain roots, Cape Town, South Africa and the greater Africa. “On my journey I discovered places and people that inspired and connected me with the sounds of the Ghoema, Cape Jazz, Smooth Jazz, Fusion and a sound that I can now acknowledge as my own,” said the musician. Ehrenreich’s musical history dates back many years as he came from a musically-inclined family, but his official journey started at age 11 at The Ubuntu Music Academy, where he studied under guitarist Rodney Adonis, and developed a passion for jazz. Though very young, Timothy quickly gained skill and proficiency in playing the guitar, and attracted the attention of local guitar legend Derrick Scheepers, who grew to become his mentor and close friend. By age 16 Ehrenreich was Cape Town's youngest full-time performing musician and sought-after jazz guitarist, working with well-known local and international artists in Cape Town and on tour to other cities. The guitarist's career highlights include being nominated to perform at the Artscape Youth Jazz Festival, recording with musician Tony Drake and performing with internationally-renowned jazz guitarist Jonathan Butler. Tickets for the live performance were available at R150 and for the live stream at R80 with doors opening at 5pm for the start of the show at 6pm.
