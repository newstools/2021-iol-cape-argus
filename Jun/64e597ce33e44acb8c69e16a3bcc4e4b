The Cape Argus edition on Friday, June 11 – “Man wins appeal against eight-year jail term for stealing R30, pack of cigarettes” refers: It is unbelievable to read an article of this nature as we regularly hear about connected cadres and other high flying members of the governing party who are stealing millions and millions and seem never to get even prosecuted. This is sending a message out to the public that if you steal a lot you get away with it, but if you get caught with a minor theft because you are hungry you are going to sit in jail. This seems to be pointing to a topsy turvy world and the more bizarre something is, the more believable it becomes. * Michael Bagraim, Highlands Estate. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
