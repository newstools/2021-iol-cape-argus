Cape Town - The City of Cape Town’s law-enforcement agencies arrested 199 suspects over the past week, including a suspect who was busted with R50 000 worth of cocaine. A total of 84 319 fines for various transgressions were issued. In a statement, mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said the suspect was arrested for the second time in three months by the metro police’s K9 Unit. On Saturday, officers attached to the unit conducting crime prevention patrols pulled over a green Toyota Corolla after they noticed the vehicle’s broken tail light. Upon approaching the vehicle officers smelled cannabis, leading them to search the vehicle, where they discovered a plastic bag containing 61 units of rock cocaine. The 31-year-old man was arrested and detained at Bothasig police station. It was later discovered that the suspect was out on bail on a similar offence after he was arrested by the same unit three months ago. “The fact that the suspect was arrested for the second time in just three months shows that there are serious challenges in the criminal justice system,” said Smith. “Our officers do their part in successfully arresting a suspect on a serious illegal drug offence and hand the suspect over to the SAPS. “The second part of a successful conviction relies on the criminal justice system to ensure that an effective investigation takes place to support a conviction,” Smith said. He said he hopes the challenges in the criminal justice system will be addressed to avoid the cycle of repeat offenders. Law Enforcement arrested 64 suspects and issued 4 588 fines for various by-law transgressions. Smith said its Traffic Services arrested 70 suspects, impounded 153 vehicles, confiscated 165 cellphones and issued 74 868 fines. African News Agency (ANA)
